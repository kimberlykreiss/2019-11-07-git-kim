# Git Workshop DCR 2019 

- `init`: initialize folder as git repo
- `status`: see what is going on in the repo 
- `add`: put file(s) into staging area 
- `commit`: commit files from staging area 

# Notes 

- git config --list (shows your configs)
ls -al (list all hidden files in this folder) 
nano README.md

git add . vs git add --all 
git add . is everything in this folder and down 
git add --all is everything in the repo 

- `diff`: see the changes that were made between different files. git diff --staged shows what's different after files are staged 
- git diff HEAD~2 (show the differences between current and two commits ago)
